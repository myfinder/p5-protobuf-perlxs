This is a simple example of how to build a Perl/XS wrapper class that
works with a Protocol Buffers message object that has embedded message
types.

The message object is defined in "error.proto", and is an example of
what one might like to know about a runtime error that occurs in an
Apache/mod_perl environment.  To build the Perl/XS wrapper, all you 
need to do is:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

At this point, you should have generated C++ and Perl/XS sources, and
those source should have been compiled and tested.  The test script
creates an Error object and exercises it through its life cycle.
