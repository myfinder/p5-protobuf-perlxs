This is an example of a package (Local::Messages) that contains
several top-level message types:

Local::Messages::One
Local::Messages::Two
Local::Messages::Three

To get this to work, we need to add an XS file and a Perl module
for the containing package, and execute the bootup code from there.
The Perl modules for the contained packages are not needed, so they
are removed after they are generated.  The POD documentation for the
contained packages is preserved.
