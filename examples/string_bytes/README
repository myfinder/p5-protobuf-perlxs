This example tests packing of messages with string and bytes fields.
There were two issues (addressed in release 0.7) that lead to the
creation of this example.  The first issue was that the ZeroCopyStream
implementation in the generated code was failing to pack messages that
were a multiple of 8 bytes in length.  The second issue was that if a
string or bytes field contained embedded NULL characters, everything
after the first NULL was ignored when packing the field.
